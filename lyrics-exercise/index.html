            <p>Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh</p>
            <p>Is it that sweet? I guess so</p>
            <p>Say you can't sleep, baby, I know</p>
            <p>That's that me, espresso</p>
            <br>
            <p>Move it up, down, left, right, oh</p>
            <p>Switch it up like Nintendo</p>
            <br>
            <p>Say you can't sleep, baby, I know</p>
            <p>That's that me, espresso</p>
            <br>
            <p>I can't relate to desperation</p>
            <p>My 'give a fucks' are on vacation</p>
            <br>
            <p>And I got this one boy</p>
            <p>And he won't stop calling</p>
            <br>
            <p>When they act this way</p>
            <p>I know I got 'em</p>
            <br>
            <p>Too bad your ex don't do it for ya</p>
            <p>Walked in and dream came trued it for ya</p>
            <br>
            <p>Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya</p>
            <p>I know I Mountain Dew it for ya</p>
            <br>
            <p>That morning coffee, brewed it for ya</p>
            <p>One touch and I brand newed it for ya</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh</p>

            <br>
            <p>I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer</p>
            <p>Oh, he looks so cute wrapped around my finger</p>
            <br>
            <p>My twisted humor, make him laugh so often</p>
            <p>My honey bee, come and get this pollen</p>
            <br>
            <p>Too bad your ex don't do it for ya</p>
