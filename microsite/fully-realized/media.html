            <h3>Documentaries</h3>
            <p class="text">The significance of graffiti in New York City has been documented extensively in films and documentaries, which capture the evolution of this unique art form.</p>
            <p class="text"><b>Style Wars (1983):</b> Directed by Tony Silver, this documentary is considered a cornerstone of street art documentaries. It delves into the competitive spirit and creative energy of young graffiti writers in 1980s New York and provides a raw and authentic portrayal of the subculture.</p>
            <p class="text"><b>Wild Style (1983):</b> Directed by Charlie Ahearn, this feature film is recognized as the first “hip-hop” film. It portrays the early stages of graffiti culture, underscoring its integration into the broader hip-hop movement.</p>
            <p class="text"><b>Stations of the Elevated (1981):</b> Directed by Manfred Kirchheimer, this film is often noted for its pioneering exploration of NYC graffiti.

            <h3>Essays and Academic Works</h3>
            <p class="text">Norman Mailer’s essay "The Faith of Graffiti" (1974) is one of the earliest and most significant literary works discussing NYC graffiti. The essay was controversial for its attempt to validate graffiti as an art form, linking it with renowned artists of the past. Mailer’s work delves into the political and artistic implications of graffiti, portraying it as a form of subversive activity and existential resistance against societal norms.</p>
            <p class="text">The essay examines the lives and inspirations of prominent graffiti artists and addresses the tension between graffiti as an artistic expression and its criminalization by city authorities. Mailer’s philosophical musings connect graffiti to historical art movements, asserting graffiti's place in the continuum of artistic endeavor.</p>
            <h3>Impact on Popular Culture</h3>
            <p class="text"><b>Music Videos:</b> Graffiti art often appears in music videos, symbolizing rebellion and urban authenticity. Its visual impact enhances the aesthetic of hip-hop and related genres, solidifying its status in the cultural mainstream.</p>
            <p class="text"><b>Television and Films:</b> Shows like HBO's "The Wire" and films like "Kids" (1995) by Harmony Korine incorporate graffiti to depict urban youth culture and anti-authoritarian themes.</p>            
            <p class="text"><b>Art Exhibitions:</b> Graffiti has transitioned from the streets to galleries and museums. Exhibitions featuring artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring have legitimized graffiti as a form of fine art, blurring the line between illegal street art and sanctioned gallery pieces.</p>            
            <h3>Portrayal in Mainstream News Media</h3>
            <p class="text">The portrayal of graffiti in mainstream news has evolved over the decades. Initially, graffiti was seen predominantly as vandalism associated with urban decay. However, as public perception shifted, graffiti began to be recognized for its artistic value and cultural significance.</p>
            <p class="text">New York Magazine highlights the transformation of graffiti from an eyesore to an urban amenity, showcasing its role in urban revitalization and gentrification efforts. Other media outlets have documented the commercial aspects of graffiti, noting its use in advertising and fashion, which has further complicated its public perception.</p>
            <h3>Commercialization and Social Media</h3>
            <p class="text">The commercialization of graffiti has opened new avenues for artists. Legal and commissioned works have become commonplace, and graffiti is now a major element in advertising, fashion, and video games. Social media platforms like Instagram have further amplified the reach of graffiti, allowing artists to share their work globally and gain recognition beyond their local scenes.</p>
