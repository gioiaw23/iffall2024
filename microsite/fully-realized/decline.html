                <h1>DECLINE OF NYC GRAFFITI CULTURE</h1>
            </div>
        </section>

        <div class="information">
            <h3>Early Enforcement and Control Measures</h3>
            <p class="text">The decline of graffiti culture in New York City began in the late 1970s and early 1980s when graffiti increasingly became associated with urban decay and criminal behavior. As the popularity of the "broken windows theory" grew, so did calls for a more serious stance against graffiti. By the early 1980s, increased police surveillance, the installation of security measures like razor wire and guard dogs, and continuous cleanup efforts began weakening the graffiti subculture.</p>
            <h3>Clean Train Movement</h3>
            <p class="text">The Clean Train Movement, initiated in 1985 by the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), was a significant turning point in the battle against subway graffiti. This movement aimed to clean or replace graffiti-covered subway cars systematically. Over the subsequent years, it drastically reduced the number of graffitied subway cars, culminating in the last graffiti-covered train being removed from service by 1989. The increased security and the programâ€™s thoroughness made it exceedingly difficult for graffiti artists to tag trains, pushing many artists to shift their focus to other public spaces like rooftops and walls.</p>
            <h3>Increased Police Surveillance and Stricter Penalties</h3>
            <p class="text">Another crucial factor was the heightened police measures and stricter penalties against graffiti. In the 1980s, legislation made penalties for graffiti more severe, and changes in regulations restricted the sale and display of spray paint. The Anti-Graffiti Task Force, established by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in 1995, further intensified these efforts, creating one of the largest anti-graffiti campaigns in U.S. history. The combination of rapid graffiti removal and increased risks for offenders curbed the culture significantly.</p>
            <h3>Changing Demographics and Gentrification</h3>
            <p class="text">The socio-economic changes brought by gentrification also contributed to the decline of traditional graffiti. Neighborhoods undergoing gentrification saw cultural and demographic shifts that often clashed with the rebellious roots of graffiti culture. Areas like Williamsburg and Bushwick transitioned from industrial zones to trendy neighborhoods, leading to developers using aesthetically pleasing graffiti murals to attract new, wealthier residents, further diluting the original graffiti subculture. This commercialization of street art often marginalized traditional graffiti artists, as their work became commodified in a rapidly changing urban landscape.</p>
            <h3>Rise of Street Art and Legitimate Art Form</h3>
            <p class="text">As graffiti faced growing opposition from city authorities, it began to evolve into street art, which gained acceptance as a legitimate art form. This transition allowed artists to explore new styles and techniques, often with legal permission, helping to transform graffiti from a perceived act of vandalism to accepted public art. Notable figures such as Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring started in the streets but were able to transition into mainstream art, further illustrating this shift. As street art gained legitimacy, it also became a tool for branding and advertising, further mainstreaming the culture away from its underground roots.</p>
            <h3>Technological Advancements and Social Media</h3>
            <p class="text">In the late 1990s and 2000s, the rise of social media and online platforms played a significant role in evolving graffiti culture. Artists could now share their work globally, reaching audiences far beyond their local neighborhoods. This digital transformation allowed graffiti to blend with other artistic forms and gain further legitimacy. Platforms like Instagram facilitated the documentation and spread of graffiti art, allowing artists to maintain a presence despite increased physical restrictions.</p>
